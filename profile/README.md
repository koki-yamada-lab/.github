## About
We build on methods from mathematical statistics, machine learning, and signal processing to study AI for Science—AI that supports scientific discovery—and to tackle a wide range of real-world problems. In particular, we focus on the analysis of graph-structured data (graph data analysis) and are developing techniques that explicitly account for complex relationships among entities. Through this work, we aim to uncover structural features and dependencies that are often overlooked by conventional approaches, leading to new scientific insights. We also pursue research in measurement informatics, integrating measurement technologies such as X-ray diffraction imaging with information science.

Our main interests include:
- Graph signal processing / graph machine learning
- Measurement informatics (X-ray ptychography, Coherent Diffraction Imaging)
- AI for Science
